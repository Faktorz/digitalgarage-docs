[[build-resources]]
== Setting Build Resources

By default, builds are completed by pods using unbound resources, such as memory
and CPU. These resources can be limited by specifying resource limits in a
project's default container limits.

You can also limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the
build configuration. In the following example, each of the `resources`,
`cpu`, and `memory` parameters are optional:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "100m" <1>
      memory: "256Mi" <2>
----
<1> `cpu` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<2> `memory` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 * 2 ^ 20).

However, if a xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-quotas[quota] has
been defined for your project, one of the following two items is required:

- A `resources` section set with an explicit `requests`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  requests: <1>
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "256Mi"
----
<1> The `requests` object contains the list of resources that correspond to
the list of resources in the quota.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated,openshift-origin[]
- A xref:../../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[limit range] defined in your project, where the
defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the
build process.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
- A limit range defined in your project, where the
defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the
build process.
endif::[]

Otherwise, build pod creation will fail, citing a failure to satisfy quota.

[[builds-setting-maximum-duration]]
== Setting Maximum Duration

When defining a `BuildConfig`, you can define its maximum duration by setting
the  `completionDeadlineSeconds` field. It is specified in seconds and is not
set by default. When not set, there is no maximum duration enforced.

The maximum duration is counted from the time when a build pod gets scheduled in
the system, and defines how long it can be active, including the time needed to
pull the builder image. After reaching the specified timeout, the build is
terminated by {product-title}.

The following example shows the part of a `BuildConfig` specifying
`completionDeadlineSeconds` field for 30 minutes:

----
spec:
  completionDeadlineSeconds: 1800
----

[[dev-guide-assigning-builds-to-nodes]]
== Assigning Builds to Specific Nodes

Builds can be targeted to run on specific nodes by specifying labels in the
`nodeSelector` field of a build configuration. The `nodeSelector` value is a set
of key/value pairs that are matched to `node` labels when scheduling the build
pod.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  nodeSelector:<1>
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
----
<1> Builds associated with this build configuration will run only on nodes with the `key1=value2` and `key2=value2` labels.

The `nodeSelector` value can also be controlled by cluster-wide default and
override values. Defaults will only be applied if the build configuration does
not define any key/value pairs for the `nodeSelector` and also does not define
an explicitly empty map value of `nodeSelector:{}`. Override values will replace
values in the build configuration on a key by key basis.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See
xref:../../install_config/build_defaults_overrides.adoc#install-config-build-defaults-overrides[Configuring Global Build Defaults and Overrides] for more information.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
If the specified `NodeSelector` cannot be matched to a node with those labels,
the build still stay in the `Pending` state indefinitely.
