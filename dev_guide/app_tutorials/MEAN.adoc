= The MEAN Stack on Digital Garage

== Overview

The MEAN stack is a potent new concoction of javascript-flavored
tooling, services, and frameworks that make modern, single-page
application design a breeze.

{product-title} provides a developer Quickstart template for building MEAN
applications. This Quickstart includes a MongoDB instance, a NodeJS instance,
Express and AngularJS. An example Hello World application is included to demostrate
the connectivity between the elements of the stack and give you a quick start on
building your MEAN application. Have fun and GO/CODE.

Just like the classic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29[LAMP stack],
the MEAN stack is not an official standard or vendor-specific product.
Both stacks simply represent a loose collection of best-of-breed open
source solutions that can be easily customized, reconfigured, and
replaced as needed. In fact, as LAMP became more popular and it’s
related community grew, the "*P*" which originally just stood for *Perl*
was redefined and expanded to represent *PHP* and *Python* as well.

[[_getting_started]]
MEAN Stack sample app on Digital Garage!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MEAN stack is a popular, open-source, full-stack JavaScript
framework for building dynamic websites and web applications by
combining useful JavaScript modules such as MongoDB, Express.js,
AngularJS, and Node.js. The MEAN Stack has achieved a high level of
harmony between the client and server. In fact, the MEAN Stack is
JavaScript from front to back which means that these applications are
quick to put together, and represent the modern state of web application
development.

In this brief tutorial we combine the MEAN Stack with best practices in
both application architecture and deployment, namely, Microservices and
Linux Containers. We will bootstrap our MEAN Stack application on the
popular PaaS provider, the Digital Garage. Digital Garage utilizes Red
Hat Openshift, Google Kubernetes and Docker Containers to create an open
and efficient way to incorporate these best practices into our project.

[[prerequisites]]
Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A Github account. If you do not already have a Github account, you can
follow https://github.com/join?source=header-home[this link] to sign up
for free.
* A Digital Garage Account. If you do not already have a Digital Garage
account, you can sign up for free at
http://cochera.thedigitalgarage.io/free-signup/mean[www.thedigitalgarage.io].

[[bootstrapping-the-mean-stack]]
Bootstrapping the MEAN Stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be:

* Forking the MEAN seed project on the Digital Garage Github
Organization to your private repository.
* Creating a MEAN Stack application workspace on the Digital Garage
platform.
* Bootstrapping the MEAN Stack in your MEAN Stack Application workspace
with MongoDB and Node.js containers from Docker Hub.
* Building the AngularJS application from the source in the forked
repository and deploying the application on the MEAN Stack.

After signing into your Github account, go to:
link:www.github.com/thedigitalgarage/mean-ex[www.github.com/thdigitalgarage/mean-ex]
and fork the repository into your own account. This repository contains
some files and a file structure that will give you a quick start on your
MEAN application. I go into more detail on the files and file structure
a little further into the tutorial. For now, let's complete our setup by
logging into your Digital Garage account and set up the MEAN stack.

After signing into your Digital Garage account, Choose the Add to
Project link in the top menu bar to go to the template catalog.

image:http://assets-digitalgarage-infra.apps.thedigitalgarage.io/images/screenshots/add_to_project.png[Add
To Project]

In the add to project screen, choose the MEAN Stack Quickstart (qs-mean)
from the catalog.

image:http://assets-digitalgarage-infra.apps.thedigitalgarage.io/images/screenshots/choose_quickstart.png[Add
To Project]

In the template configuration page for the MEAN Stack Quickstart change
the Git Repository URL to point to the repository that was just forked
into your account. `https://github.com/johnmccawley/mean-ex.git`. If you
are running this tutorial in the free Hello World tier, you will want to
set the `Memory Limit` for MongoDB to 128Mi rather than the default
192Mi. This will give your application enough room to build and deploy
all of the containers it needs. For the rest of the parameters, you can
simply accept the defaults for the remaining parameters and click
"Create"

image:http://assets-digitalgarage-infra.apps.thedigitalgarage.io/images/screenshots/quickstart-configure.png[Add
To Project]

That's it. Digital Garage is now setting up your MEAN Stack. On the next
page you'll be presented with some information about your new
application. When you are ready, click "Continue to Overview". You will
be taken to the Project Overview screen where you can watch Digital
Garage do the setup work for you. In just a few minutes you'll have full
MEAN stack running in containers and managed through Google Kubernetes.
When MongoDB and Node.js are completely deployed, (the pod status circle
is Green) simply click on the application URL in the upper right corner
of the overview screen. You will be taken to a browser to see a simple
"Hello World" message.

[[file-structure]]
File Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have the MEAN Example repository forked into your account,
let's take a few minutes to review the file structure for the
repository. There are many ways to structure a MEAN application. I have
tried to take the best-practices from several tutorials and create a
simple yet expandable file structure for this example project. For
further reading on file structures for the MEAN Stack,
http://mean.io[Mean.io] is a good boilerplate to see best practices and
how to separate file structure. For now we will just use the following
structure and adjust as we go.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

mean-ex
  ├── app - files for node components (models, routes)
  ├── config - all our configuration will be here
  │   └── database.js
  ├── LICENSE
  ├── openshift
  │   └── templates
  │       └── qs-mean.json - example template for Kubernetes.
  ├── public - files for our front-end angular application
  │   ├── app.js
  │   └── index.html
  ├── package.json -npm configuration to install dependencies/modules
  ├── README.md
  ├── tests - files for basic test scripts
  └── server.js -Node configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations! You have deployed your first application on the MEAN
Stack.

[[bootstrapping-your-application-via-the-command-line-interface-cli]]
Bootstrapping your application via the Command-Line-Interface (CLI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a new application using the web console or by running the
`oc new-app` command from the CLI. With the OpenShift CLI there are
three ways to create a new application, by specifying either:

*
http://docs.thedigitalgarage.io/dev_guide/new_app.html#specifying-source-code[With
source code]
*
http://docs.thedigitalgarage.io/dev_guide/new_app.html#specifying-a-template[Via
templates]
*
http://docs.thedigitalgarage.io/dev_guide/new_app.html#specifying-an-image[DockerHub
images]

[[create-a-new-app-from-source-code-method-1]]
Create a new app from source code (method 1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pointing `oc new-app` at source code kicks off a chain of events, for
our example run:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    $ oc new-app https://github.com/thedigitalgarage/mean-ex -l name=myapp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tool will inspect the source code, locate an appropriate image on
DockerHub, create an ImageStream for that image, and then create the
right build configuration, deployment configuration and service
definition.

(The -l flag will apply a label of "name=myapp" to all the resources
created by new-app, for easy management later.)

[[create-a-new-app-from-a-template-method-2]]
Create a new app from a template (method 2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can also
http://docs.thedigitalgarage.io/dev_guide/new_app.html#specifying-a-template[create
new apps using template files]. Clone the demo app source code from
https://github.com/thedigitalgarage/mean-ex[GitHub repo] (fork if you
like).

-----------------------------------------------------------
    $ git clone https://github.com/thedigitalgarage/mean-ex
-----------------------------------------------------------

Looking at the repo, you'll notice one file in the openshift/templates
directory:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
mean-ex
  ├── app - files for node components (models, routes)
  ├── config - all our configuration will be here
  │   └── database.js
  ├── LICENSE
  ├── openshift
  │   └── templates
  │       └── qs-mean.json - example template for Kubernetes.
  ├── public - files for our front-end angular application
  │   ├── app.js
  │   └── index.html
  ├── package.json -npm configuration to install dependencies/modules
  ├── README.md
  ├── tests - files for basic test scripts
  └── server.js -Node configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We can create the the new app from the `qs-nodejs-mongo.json` template
by using the `-f` flag and pointing the tool at a path to the template
file:

-------------------------------------------------
    $ oc new-app -f /path/to/qs-nodejs-mongo.json
-------------------------------------------------

[[build-the-app]]
Build the app
+++++++++++++

`oc new-app` will kick off a build once all required dependencies are
confirmed.

Check the status of your new nodejs app with the command:

---------------
    $ oc status
---------------

Which should return something like:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In project my-project on server https://10.2.2.2:8443

    svc/mean-ex - 172.30.108.183:8080
      dc/mean-ex deploys istag/nodejs-ex:latest <-
        bc/mean-ex builds https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex with openshift/nodejs:0.10
          build #1 running for 7 seconds
        deployment #1 waiting on image or update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You can follow along with the web console to see what new
resources have been created and watch the progress of builds and
deployments.

If the build is not yet started (you can check by running
`oc get builds`), start one and stream the logs with:

-------------------------------------
    $ oc start-build mean-ex --follow
-------------------------------------

You can alternatively leave off `--follow` and use
`oc logs build/mean-ex-n` where _n_ is the number of the build to track
the output of the build.

[[deploy-the-app]]
Deploy the app
++++++++++++++

Deployment happens automatically once the new application image is
available. To monitor its status either watch the web console or execute
`oc get pods` to see when the pod is up. Another helpful command is

----------------
    $ oc get svc
----------------

This will help indicate what IP address the service is running, the
default port for it to deploy at is 8080. Output should look like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NAME        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    SELECTOR                                AGE
    mean-ex   172.30.249.251   <none>        8080/TCP   deploymentconfig=nodejs-ex,name=myapp   17m
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[configure-routing]]
Configure routing
+++++++++++++++++

An OpenShift route exposes a service at a host name, like
www.example.com, so that external clients can reach it by name.

DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing; you
may wish to configure a cloud domain that will always correctly resolve
to the OpenShift router, or if using an unrelated host name you may need
to modify its DNS records independently to resolve to the router.

After logging into the web console with your account credentials, make
sure you are in the correct project/workspace and then click
`Create route`.

This could also be accomplished by running:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    $ oc expose svc/mean-ex --hostname=myapp-myproject.apps.thedigitalgarage.io
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in the CLI.

Now navigate to the newly created MEAN web app at the hostname we just
configured.

[[setting-environment-variables]]
Setting environment variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To take a look at environment variables set for each pod, run
`oc env pods --all --list`.

[[success]]
Success
+++++++

You should now have a MEAN welcome page rendered via AngularJS.

[[pushing-updates]]
Pushing updates
+++++++++++++++

Assuming you used the URL of your own forked repository, we can easily
push changes and simply repeat the steps above which will trigger the
newly built image to be deployed.
