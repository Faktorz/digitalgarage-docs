How to setup GoDaddy domain with a Digital Garage application
-------------------------------------------------------------

When you have implemented an application in Digital Garage, you are able
to access this application through a route automatically generated by
the platform. However, it is possible to link a custom domain to the
implementation.

To make the application accessible through a custom domain it is
necessary to make some changes in the domain configuration on the DNS
provider page.

As part of this example, this tutorial will use:

* *"makkasoft.net"* as a domain name purchased in GoDaddy.
* *"hello-world.apps.thedigitalgarage.io"* as the alias/route of the
Digital Garage application.

*1. Add aliases/routes to the Digital Garage application*

Is necessary to add 2 routes with the purchased domain name. One with a
"www" and another without. Go to the Digital Garage web console and add
2 aliases/routes to the application.

It should be something like this:

*2. Edit CNAME register in GoDaddy*

In order to get your domain pointing to the application implemented in
Digital Garage, is necessary to edit the *CNAME* register with *www*
subdomain.

* Log in to your GoDaddy account.
* On your product list next to *Domains*, click the

button) to expand the list:

* Next to the domain you want to manage, under the *Action* section,
click on the *Manage DNS* button:

* Identify the *CNAME* register with *www* subdomain, click the edit
button (pencil sign), fill the "*Points to*" field with the application
alias generated by Digital Garage and the click in the "*Save*" button:

*3. Create domain forwarding*

To operate the root path of the domain "*makkasoft.net*" (no *www*), you
must create a redirect. At the same DNS management page used in the
previous step you will see the *"Forwarding*" section:

Click the "ADD" button to add a domain forwarding with the following
values (See the image):

After saving changes, GoDaddy will take between 10 to 15 minutes to
perform the update and you can access the application from the domain.
Thus, when you try to access the root domain "*makkasoft.net*" will
redirect to "**http://www.makkasoft.net[www.makkasoft.ne**t]".
