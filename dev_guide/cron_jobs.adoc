== Overview

A _cron job_ builds on a regular
xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#dev-guide-jobs[job] by allowing you to specifically
schedule how the job should be run. Cron jobs are part of the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/cron-jobs[Kubernetes] API, which
can be managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types].

== Creating a Cron Job

A cron job configuration consists of the following key parts:

* A schedule specified in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron format].
* A job template used when creating the next job.
* An optional deadline (in seconds) for starting the job if it misses its
scheduled time for any reason. Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed
ones. If not specified, there is no deadline.
* `*ConcurrencyPolicy*`: An optional concurrency policy, specifying how to treat
concurrent jobs within a cron job. Only one of the following concurrent
policies may be specified. If not specified, this defaults to allowing
concurrent executions.
** `Allow` allows Cron Jobs to run concurrently.
** `Forbid` forbids concurrent runs, skipping the next run if the previous has not
finished yet.
** `Replace` cancels the currently running job and replaces
it with a new one.
* An optional flag allowing the suspension of a cron job. If set to `true`,
all subsequent executions will be suspended.

The following is an example of a `*CronJob*` resource:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v2alpha1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"  <1>
  jobTemplate:             <2>
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: pi
            image: perl
            command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
          restartPolicy: Never

1. Schedule for the job. In this example, a job will run every minute.
2. Job template. This is similar to the xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#creating-a-job[job example].
