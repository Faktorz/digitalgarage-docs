involve running two versions of an application at the same time and
moving production traffic from the old version to the new version. There are
several ways to implement a blue-green deployment in {product-title}.

[[advanced-deployment-strategies-when-to-use-blue-green-deployment]]
=== When to Use a Blue-Green Deployment

Use a blue-green deployment when you want to test a new version of your
application in a production environment before moving traffic to it.

Blue-green deployments make switching between two different versions of your
application easy. However, since many applications depend on persistent data,
you will need to have an application that supports xref:n1-compatibility[N-1
compatibility] if you share a database, or implement a live data migration
between your database, store, or disk if you choose to create two copies of your
data layer.

[[advanced-deployment-strategies-blue-green-deployments-example]]
=== Blue-Green Deployment Example

In order to maintain control over two distinct groups of instances (old and new
versions of the code), the blue-green deployment is best represented with
multiple deployment configurations.

[[advanced-deployment-strategies-using-a-route-and-two-services]]
==== Using a Route and Two Services

A route points to a service, and can be changed to point to a different service
at any time. As a developer, test the new version of your code by connecting to
the new service before your production traffic is routed to it. Routes are
intended for web (HTTP and HTTPS) traffic, so this technique is best suited
for web applications.

. Create two copies of the example application:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v1 --name=example-green
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v2 --name=example-blue
----
+
This will create two independent application components: one running the *v1*
image under the `example-green` service, and one using the *v2* image under the
`example-blue` service.

. Create a route that points to the old service:
+
----
$ oc expose svc/example-green --name=bluegreen-example
----

. Browse to the application at `bluegreen-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to
verify you see the *v1* image.
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
On versions of {product-title} older than v3.0.1, this command will generate a
route at `example-green.<project>.<router_domain>`, not the above location.
====

[NOTE]
====
On versions of {product-title} older than v1.0.3, this command will generate a
route at `example-green.<project>.<router_domain>`, not the above location.
====
endif::[]

. Edit the route and change the service name to `example-blue`:
+
----
$ oc patch route/bluegreen-example -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"example-blue"}}}'
----

. In your browser, refresh the page until you see the *v2* image.

[[advanced-deployment-a-b-deployment]]
== A/B Deployment

A/B deployments generally imply running two (or more) versions of the
application code or application configuration at the same time for testing or
experimentation purposes.

The simplest form of an A/B deployment is to divide production traffic between
two or more distinct *shards* -- a single group of instances with homogeneous
configuration and code.

More complicated A/B deployments may involve a specialized proxy or load
balancer that assigns traffic to specific shards based on information about the
user or application (all "test" users get sent to the B shard, but regular users
get sent to the A shard).

A/B deployments can be considered similar to A/B testing, although an A/B
deployment implies multiple versions of code and configuration, where as A/B
testing often uses one code base with application specific checks.

[[advanced-deployment-when-to-use-a-b-deployment]]
=== When to Use an A/B Deployment

* When you want to test multiple versions of code or configuration, but are not
planning to roll one out in preference to the other.
* When you want to have different configuration in different regions.

An A/B deployment groups different configuration and code -- multiple shards --
together under a single logical endpoint. Generally, these deployments, if they
access persistent data, should properly deal with N-1 compatibility (the more
shards you have, the more possible versions you have running). Use this pattern
when you need separate internal configuration and code, but end users should not
be aware of the changes.

[[advanced-deployment-a-b-deployment-example]]
=== A/B Deployment Example

All A/B deployments are composite deployment types consisting of multiple
deployment configurations.

[[advanced-deployment-one-service-multiple-deployment-configs]]
==== One Service, Multiple Deployment Configurations

{product-title}, through labels and deployment configurations, supports multiple
simultaneous shards being exposed through the same service. To the consuming
user, the shards are invisible. An example of the simplest possible sharding is
described below:

. Create the first shard of the application based on the example deployment images:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example --name=ab-example-a --labels=ab-example=true SUBTITLE="shard A"
----

. Edit the newly created shard to set a label `ab-example=true` that will be
common to all shards:
+
----
$ oc edit dc/ab-example-a
----
+
In the editor, add the line `ab-example: "true"` underneath `spec.selector` and
`spec.template.metadata.labels` alongside the existing
`deploymentconfig=ab-example-a` label. Save and exit the editor.

. Trigger a re-deployment of the first shard to pick up the new labels:
+
----
$ oc deploy ab-example-a --latest
----

. Create a service that uses the common label:
+
----
$ oc expose dc/ab-example-a --name=ab-example --selector=ab-example=true
----
+
If you have the router installed, make the application available via a route (or
use the service IP directly):
+
----
$ oc expose svc/ab-example
----
+
Browse to the application at `ab-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to verify
you see the *v1* image.

. Create a second shard based on the same source image as the first shard but
different tagged version, and set a unique value:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v2 --name=ab-example-b --labels=ab-example=true SUBTITLE="shard B" COLOR="red"
----

. Edit the newly created shard to set a label `ab-example=true` that will be
common to all shards:
+
----
$ oc edit dc/ab-example-b
----
+
In the editor, add the line `ab-example: "true"` underneath `spec.selector` and
`spec.template.metadata.labels` alongside the existing
`deploymentconfig=ab-example-b` label. Save and exit the editor.

. Trigger a re-deployment of the second shard to pick up the new labels:
+
----
$ oc deploy ab-example-b --latest
----

. At this point, both sets of pods are being served under the route. However,
since both browsers (by leaving a connection open) and the router (by default,
through a cookie) will attempt to preserve your connection to a back-end server,
you may not see both shards being returned to you. To force your browser to one
or the other shard, use the scale command:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/ab-example-a --replicas=0
----
+
Refreshing your browser should show *v2* and *shard B* (in red).
+
----
$ oc scale dc/ab-example-a --replicas=1; oc scale dc/ab-example-b --replicas=0
----
+
Refreshing your browser should show *v1* and *shard A* (in blue).
+
If you trigger a deployment on either shard, only the pods in that shard will be
affected. You can easily trigger a deployment by changing the `SUBTITLE`
environment variable in either deployment config `oc edit dc/ab-example-a` or
`oc edit dc/ab-example-b`. You can add additional shards by repeating steps 5-7.
+
[NOTE]
====
These steps will be simplified in future versions of {product-title}.

[[proxy-shard-traffic-splitter]]
== Proxy Shard / Traffic Splitter

In production environments, you can precisely control the distribution
of traffic that lands on a particular shard. When dealing with large numbers of
instances, you can use the relative scale of individual shards to implement
percentage based traffic. That combines well with a *proxy shard*, which
forwards or splits the traffic it receives to a separate service or application
running elsewhere.

In the simplest configuration, the proxy would forward requests unchanged. In
more complex setups, you can duplicate the incoming requests and send to
both a separate cluster as well as to a local instance of the application, and
compare the result. Other patterns include keeping the caches of a DR
installation warm, or sampling incoming traffic for analysis purposes.

While an implementation is beyond the scope of this example, any TCP (or UDP)
proxy could be run under the desired shard. Use the `oc scale` command to alter
the relative number of instances serving requests under the proxy shard. For
more complex traffic management, consider customizing the {product-title} router
with proportional balancing capabilities.

[[n1-compatibility]]
== N-1 Compatibility

Applications that have new code and old code running at the same time must be
careful to ensure that data written by the new code can be read by the old code.
This is sometimes called _schema evolution_ and is a complex problem.

For some applications, the period of time that old code and new code is running
side by side is short, so bugs or some failed user transactions are
acceptable. For others, the failure pattern may result in the entire application
becoming non-functional.

One way to validate N-1 compatibility is to use an A/B deployment. Run the old
code and new code at the same time in a controlled way in a test environment,
and verify that traffic that flows to the new deployment does not cause failures
in the old deployment.

[[graceful-termination]]
== Graceful Termination

{product-title} and Kubernetes give application instances time to shut down
before removing them from load balancing rotations. However, applications must
ensure they cleanly terminate user connections as well before they exit.

On shutdown, {product-title} will send a *TERM* signal to the processes in the
container. Application code, on receiving *SIGTERM*, should stop accepting new
connections. This will ensure that load balancers route traffic to other active
instances. The application code should then wait until all open connections are
closed (or gracefully terminate individual connections at the next opportunity)
before exiting.

After the graceful termination period expires, a process that has not exited
will be sent the *KILL* signal, which immediately ends the process. The
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` attribute of a pod or pod template controls
the graceful termination period (default 30 seconds) and may be customized per
application as necessary.
