== Overview

A _Pod Disruption Budget_ is part of the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/disruptions/[Kubernetes] API, which can be
managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types]. They
allow the specification of safety constraints on pods during operations, such as
draining a node for maintenance.

== Creating a Pod Disruption Budget

A `PodDisruptionBudget` configuration consists of the following key parts:

* A label selector, which is a label query over a set of pods.
* An availability level, which specifies the minimum number of pods that must be
 available simultaneously.

The following is an example of a `PodDisruptionBudget` resource:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1alpha1 <1>
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  selector:  <2>
    matchLabels:
      foo: bar
  minAvailable: 2  <3>
----

<1> `PodDisruptionBudget` is part of the `policy/v1alpha` API group.
<2> A label query over a set of resources. The result of `matchLabels` and
 `matchExpressions` are logically conjoined.
<3> The minimum number of pods that must be available simultaneously. This can
be either an integer or a string specifying a percentage (for example, `20%`).
====

The `PodDisruptionBudget` is considered healthy when there are at least
`minAvailable` pods running in the system. Every pod above that limit can be
