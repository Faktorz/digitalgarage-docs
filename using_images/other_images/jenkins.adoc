== Overview
{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins. This image provides a Jenkins server instance, which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job, which triggers a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in {product-title}, tests the output of that build, and then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for production.

[[jenkins-version]]
== Versions

{product-title} follows the https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS] releases of Jenkins.

[[jenkins-images]]
== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your {product-title} Docker registry.
Additionally, you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the external location.
Your {product-title} resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find https://github.com/thedigitalgarage/examples/tree/master/v1.3/image-streams[example] ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.

[[jenkins-configuration-and-usage]]
== Configuration and Usage

[[jenkins-initializing-jenkins]]
=== Initializing Jenkins

You can manage Jenkins authentication in two ways:

* {product-title} OAuth authentication provided by the OpenShift Login plug-in.

* Standard authentication provided by Jenkins

[[jenkins-openshift-oauth-authentication]]
==== {product-title} OAuth authentication

http://docs.thedigitalgarage.io/dev_guide/authentication.html[OAuth
authentication] is activated by configuring the `*Configure Global Security*`
panel in the Jenkins UI, or by setting the `*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*`
environment variable on the Jenkins `*Deployment Config*` to anything other than
`false`. This activates the OpenShift Login plug-in, which retrieves the
configuration information from pod data or by interacting with the
{product-title} API server.

Valid credentials are controlled by your identity provider.
For example, if `Allow All` is the default identity provider, you can provide
any non-empty string for both the user name and password.

For non-browser access, the OpenShift Login plug-in also supports using
the HTTP bearer token authorization header to supply valid credentials for
accessing Jenkins. Ensure to use the token associated with the
serviceaccount for the project in which Jenkins is running, which, if you started
Jenkins using the https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/jenkins-ephemeral-template.json[jenkins-ephemeral]
or https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/jenkins-persistent-template.json[jenkins-persistent] templates, are found by using:

----
$ oc describe serviceaccount jenkins
$ oc describe secret <serviceaccount secret name>
----

Valid users are automatically added to the Jenkins authorization matrix at log
in, where {product-title} `*Roles*` dictate the specific Jenkins permissions the
user will have.

Users with the `admin` role will have the traditional Jenkins administrative
user permissions. Users with the `edit` or `view` role will have progressively
less permissions.  See the
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins#jenkins-admin-user[Jenkins image source
repository README] for the specifics on the OpenShift roles to Jenkins
permissions mappings.


[NOTE]
====
The `admin` user that is pre-populated in the {product-title} Jenkins image with
administrative privileges will not be given those privileges when
{product-title} OAuth is used, unless the {product-title} cluster administrator
explicitly defines that user in the {product-title} identity provider and
assigns the `admin` role to the user.
====
Jenkins' users permissions can be changed after the users are initially
established. The OpenShift Login plug-in polls the {product-title} API server
for permissions and updates the permissions stored in Jenkins for each user with
the permissions retrieved from {product-title}. If the Jenkins UI is used to
update permissions for a Jenkins user, the permission changes are overwritten
the next time the plug-in polls {product-title}.

You can control how often the polling occurs with the
`OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable. The default polling
interval is five minutes.

.Creating a New Jenkins Pod

. Ensure the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[the default image streams and templates]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
default image streams and templates
endif::[]
are already installed.

. Create a new Jenkins application using:
.. Persistent volumes:
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-persistent
----

.. Or an `EmptyDir` type volume (where configuration does not persist across pod restarts):
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
----

[NOTE]
====
If you instantiate the template against releases prior to v3.4 of
{product-title}, standard Jenkins authentication is used, and the default
'admin' account will exist with password 'password'. See
xref:../../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#jenkins-jenkins-standard-authentication[Jenkins
Standard Authentication] for details about changing this password.
====

[[jenkins-jenkins-standard-authentication]]
==== Jenkins Standard Authentication

Jenkins authentication is used by default if the image is run outside of
{product-title}.

The first time Jenkins starts, the configuration is created along with the
administrator user and password. The default user credentials are `*admin*` and
`*password*`. Configure the default password by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
environment variable when using (and only when using) standard Jenkins
authentication.

To create a new Jenkins application using standard Jenkins authentication:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

[[jenkins-environment-variables]]
=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins server can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|The password for the `*admin*` user when using standard Jenkins authentication.  Not applicable when using {product-title} OAuth authentication.

|`*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*`
|Determines whether the OpenShift Login plug-in manages authentication when logging into Jenkins. Enabled when set to any non-empty value other than "false".

|`*OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL*`
|Specifies in seconds how often the OpenShift Login plug-in polls {product-title} for the permissions associated with each user defined in Jenkins.

|===

[[jenkins-cross-project-access]]
=== Cross Project Access

If you are going to run Jenkins somewhere other than as a deployment within your same project, you will need to provide an access token to Jenkins to access your project.

. Identify the secret for the service account that has appropriate permissions
to access the project Jenkins needs to access:
+
----
$ oc describe serviceaccount default
Name:       default
Labels:     <none>
Secrets:    {  default-token-uyswp    }
            {  default-dockercfg-xcr3d    }
Tokens:     default-token-izv1u
            default-token-uyswp
----
+
In this case the secret is named `default-token-uyswp`

. Retrieve the token from the secret:
+
----
$ oc describe secret <secret name from above> # e.g. default-token-izv1u
Name:       default-token-izv1u
Labels:     <none>
Annotations:    kubernetes.io/service-account.name=default,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=32f5b661-2a8f-11e5-9528-3c970e3bf0b7
Type:   kubernetes.io/service-account-token
Data
====
ca.crt: 1066 bytes
token:  eyJhbGc..<content cut>....wRA
----

The token field contains the token value Jenkins needs to access the project.

[[jenkins-volume-mount-points]]
=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

[[jenkins-creating-jenkins-service-from-template]]
== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
{product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
for more details, if required.
endif::[]

The two available templates both define a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service],
but differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the Jenkins
content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart. To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the {product-title} deployment.

Once selected, you must xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[instantiate] the template to be able to use Jenkins.

[[jenkins-as-s2i-builder]]
== Using Jenkins as a Source-To-Image builder

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you have two options:

* Use Docker layering.
* Use the image as a Source-To-Image builder, described here.

You can use xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
to copy your custom Jenkins Jobs definitions, additional
plug-ins or replace the provided *_config.xml_* file with your own, custom, configuration.

In order to include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you need to have a Git
repository with the following directory structure:

*_plugins_*::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

*_plugins.txt_*::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install (see the section above).

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory will be copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

The following is an example build configuration that customizes the Jenkins
image in {product-title}:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-jenkins-build
spec:
  source:                       <1>
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/custom/repository
    type: Git
  strategy:                     <2>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
        namespace: openshift
    type: Source
  output:                       <3>
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: custom-jenkins:latest
----

<1> The `source` field defines the source Git repository
with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` field defines the original Jenkins image to use
as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` field defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image
you can use in deployment configuration instead of the official Jenkins image.

[[using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in-to-run-jobs]]
== Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs

The official {product-title} Jenkins image includes the pre-installed
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
plug-in] that allows Jenkins slaves to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

To use the Kubernetes plug-in, {product-title} provides three images
suitable for use as Jenkins slaves: the *_Base_*, *_Maven_*, and *_NodeJS_* images.

The first is a https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-base[base image] for Jenkins slaves:

 - It pulls in both the required tools (headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client) and the useful ones
(including git, tar, zip, nss among others).
 - It establishes the JNLP slave agent as the entrypoint.
 - It includes the oc client tooling for invoking command line operations from within Jenkins jobs, and
 - It provides Dockerfiles for both Centos and RHEL images.

Two additional images, that extends the base image are also provided, namely:

* https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-maven[Maven], and
* https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-nodejs[NodeJS]

Both the Maven and NodeJS slave images are configured as Kubernetes Pod Tempate images within the {product-title} Jenkins image's
configuration for the Kubernetes plugin.  That configuration includes labels for each of the images that can
be applied to any of your Jenkins jobs under their "Restrict where this project can be run" setting. If the label is applied,
execution of the given job will be done under an {product-title} Pod running the respective slave image.

The Maven and NodeJS Jenkins slave images provide Dockerfiles for both Centos and RHEL that you can reference when building new slave images.
Also note the `contrib` and `contrib/bin` subdirectories.  They allow for the insertion of configuration files and executable
scripts for your image.

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration
of slave images for the
Kubernetes plug-in. The Jenkins image searches for these in the existing image streams within the project that it is running in. The search specifically looks for image streams that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.

When it finds an image stream with this label, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes plug-in
configuration so you can assign your Jenkins
jobs to run in a pod running the container image provided by the image stream.

[NOTE]
====
This scanning is only performed once, when the Jenkins master is starting.
Please restart the Jenkins master if you label additional image streams(to pickup the added labels).
====

To use a container image as an Jenkins slave, the image must run the slave agent as
an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation].

This file lists the plug-ins you want to install:

----
pluginId:pluginVersion
----

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory will be copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

== Tutorial

For more details on the sample job included in this image, see this link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[tutorial].

== {product-title} Pipeline Plug-in

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plug-ins includes a plug-in which assists in the creating of CI/CD workflows that run against
an {product-title} server.  A series of build steps, post-build actions, as well as SCM-style polling are provided which equate to administrative
and operational actions on the {product-title} server and the API artifacts hosted there.

In addition to being accessible from the classic "freestyle" form of Jenkins
job, the build steps as of version 1.0.14 of the {product-title} Pipeline
Plug-in are also avaible to Jenkins Pipeline jobs via the DSL extension points
provided by the Jenkins Pipeline Plug-in. The https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/samplepipeline.json[OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline build strategy sample]
illustrates how to use the OpenShift Pipeline plugin DSL versions of its steps.

The https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the OpenShift pipeline plug-in and serves as an example of
how to leverage the plug-in for creating CI/CD flows for {product-title} in Jenkins.

See the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plug-in's README] for a detailed description of what is available.
