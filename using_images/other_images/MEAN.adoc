= The MEAN Stack on Digital Garage

== Overview

The MEAN stack is a potent new concoction of javascript-flavored
tooling, services, and frameworks that make modern, single-page
application design a breeze.

{product-title} provides a developer Quickstart template for building MEAN
applications. This Quickstart includes a MongoDB instance, a NodeJS instance,
Express and AngularJS. An example Hello World application is included to demostrate
the connectivity between the elements of the stack and give you a quick start on
building your MEAN application. Have fun and GO/CODE.

Just like the classic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29[LAMP stack],
the MEAN stack is not an official standard or vendor-specific product.
Both stacks simply represent a loose collection of best-of-breed open
source solutions that can be easily customized, reconfigured, and
replaced as needed. In fact, as LAMP became more popular and it’s
related community grew, the "*P*" which originally just stood for *Perl*
was redefined and expanded to represent *PHP* and *Python* as well.

[[_getting_started]]
Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide uses *Yeoman* and the `angular-fullstack-generator` to set up
your development environment. The folks at
http://learn.mean.io/#mean-io-hosting-mean-openshift[MEAN.io] also
provide a nice distribution of MEAN that will run well on OpenShift.

code,CodeRay,highlight
code,CodeRay,highlight
$ npm install -g grunt grunt-cli bower yo generator-angular-fullstack

You’ll also need access to the `git` command-line tools, and a MongoDB
datastore - which can be http://www.mongodb.org/downloads[installed
locally], provided as-a-service (see https://mongolab.com/[MongoLab] or
https://www.mongohq.com/[MongoHQ]), or made available via
https://www.openshift.com/blogs/set-up-local-access-to-openshift-hosted-services-with-port-forwarding[port-forwarding].
This particular distribution of the MEAN stack is configured to look for
a local installation of MongoDB when started in a development mode.

1. Create your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scaffold up a new MEAN stack application with
https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-24-yeoman-ember-the-missing-tutorial[Yeoman]
("Yo", for short) and the `angular-fullstack` generator:

code,CodeRay,highlight------------------------------------
code,CodeRay,highlight
$ yo angular-fullstack YOUR_APP_NAME
------------------------------------

When prompted, answer "yes" to every available option except Sass &
Compass support.

Now that your development environment is ready to go, initialize your
remotely-hosted OpenShift environment:

code,CodeRay,highlight---------------------------------------------------
code,CodeRay,highlight
$ yo angular-fullstack:openshift OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME
---------------------------------------------------

This command can be run multiple times in order to setup additional
OpenShift hosting environments if your OpenShift account has sufficient
capacity.

[[develop]]
https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-5-gruntjs-let-someone-else-do-my-tedious-repetitive-tasks[image:https://www.openshift.com/sites/default/files/grunt_logo.gif[grunt_logo,title="Grunt"]]
2. Develop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-5-gruntjs-let-someone-else-do-my-tedious-repetitive-tasks[Grunt]
provides a nice set of tools for assisting with dev task automation. It
includes livereload support for refreshing connected browsers during
development -
**https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-7-gruntjs-livereload-take-productivity-to-the-next-level[No
need to reload the page!]**

Run `grunt serve` to give it a try:

code,CodeRay,highlight------------- code,CodeRay,highlight
$ grunt serve
-------------

It’s usually a good idea to store your resulting project source in a
version control system. Feel free to add your own top-level git
repository by running `git init` at the root of your project. GitHub, or
similar hosting accomodations can be used at this level, to help
facilitate source code collaboration.

[[deploy]]
https://www.openshift.com/blogs/10-reasons-openshift-is-the-best-place-to-host-your-nodejs-app#git[image:https://www.openshift.com/sites/default/files/git-logo.jpg[git-logo,title="Git"]]
3. Deploy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The initial setup should create a secondary git repository to track of
the project’s build results, where client-side sources are combined,
minified, and optimised for production use.

Generate a new *build* of your application in your project’s `dist`
folder:

code,CodeRay,highlight------------- code,CodeRay,highlight
$ grunt build
-------------

Include a brief note about this release as you`add` and `commit` the new
build for deployment:

code,CodeRay,highlight--------------------------------------------------------------
code,CodeRay,highlight
$ cd dist
$ git commit -am "Launching our first BETA release - Ship it!"
--------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, use `git push` to send the release to your remote OpenShift
hosting environment:

code,CodeRay,highlight--------------------------- code,CodeRay,highlight
$ git push openshift master
---------------------------

LAMP stack afficianados should pause and take note: Your old stack
probably never included a build / optimization process, or a complete
development workflow.

[[scale]]
4. Scale
~~~~~~~~

Scaling the MEAN stack on OpenShift is easy - especially when working
with the `angular-fullstack` generator, which enables scaling by default
during the earlier `yo angular-fullstack:openshift` step.

You can check your application’s current list of container environments
(or gears) with the following command:

code,CodeRay,highlight-----------------------------------------
code,CodeRay,highlight
$ rhc app show OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME --gears
-----------------------------------------

The command output should include one front-end environment for running
nodejs, and a back-end environment for MongoDB.

Scale up your front-end by adding a second instance to your application
cluster:

code,CodeRay,highlight-------------------------------------
code,CodeRay,highlight
$ rhc app scale-up OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME
-------------------------------------

Scaling limits can be set via the command line:

code,CodeRay,highlight------------------------------------------------------------------
code,CodeRay,highlight
$ rhc cartridge scale nodejs -a OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME --min=2 --max=5
------------------------------------------------------------------

Or, in the OpenShift web console:

OpenShift Online’s https://www.openshift.com/products/pricing[free plan
includes support for running up to three containers concurrently]. You
can increase your account’s capacity by
