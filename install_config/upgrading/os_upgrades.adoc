[[upgrading-os-upgrades-impacts]]
== Impacts

When updating or upgrading your operating system (OS), either changing OS
versions or updating the system software, be aware that this can impact the
{product-title} software running on those machines. In particular, these updates
can affect the `iptables` rules or `ovs` flows that {product-title} requires to
operate.

== Solutions

Reboot the node to ensure that all of the software is running the new
versions, especially if a new kernel is installed. A reboot will also ensure
that the `docker` and {product-title} processes have been restarted, which will
force them to check that all of the rules in other services are correct.

However, if you do not wish to do a reboot of the node, then it is possible to
just restart the services that are affected, or to preserve the `iptables`
state. Both processes are described in the
xref:../../admin_guide/iptables.adoc#admin-guide-iptables[{product-title}
IPtables] topic. The `ovs` flow rules do not need to be saved, but restarting
the {product-title} node software will fix the flow rules.
