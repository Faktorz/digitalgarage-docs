When new versions of OpenShift are released, you can upgrade your existing
cluster to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub to review
the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This includes upgrading from previous minor versions, such as release 3.6 to
3.7, and applying asynchronous errata updates within a minor version (3.7.z
releases). See the xref:../../release_notes/ocp_3_7_release_notes.adoc#release-notes-ocp-3-7-release-notes[{product-title} 3.7 Release Notes] to review the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the xref:../../release_notes/v2_vs_v3.adoc#release-notes-v2-vs-v3[core architectural changes]
between the major versions, OpenShift Enterprise 2 environments cannot be
upgraded to OpenShift Enterprise 3 and require a fresh installation.

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible, so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.

== In-place or Blue-Green Upgrades

There are two methods for performing {product-title} cluster upgrades. You can
either do in-place upgrades (automated or manual), or upgrade using a
blue-green deployment method.

==== In-place Upgrades

With in-place upgrades, the cluster upgrade is performed on all hosts in a
single, running cluster: first masters and then nodes. Pods are evacuated off of
nodes and recreated on other running nodes before a node upgrade begins; this
helps reduce downtime of user applications.

If you installed using the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] or
endif::[]
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
and the *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* or inventory file that was
used is available, you can perform an
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated in-place upgrade].
Alternatively, you can
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[upgrade OpenShift
manually].

Starting with
xref:../../release_notes/ose_3_2_release_notes.adoc#ose-32-relnotes-rhba-2016-1208[RHBA-2016:1208],
upgrades from {product-title} 3.1 to 3.2 are supported for clusters using the
containerized installation method. See
xref:../../release_notes/ose_3_2_release_notes.adoc#ose-32-known-issues[Known
