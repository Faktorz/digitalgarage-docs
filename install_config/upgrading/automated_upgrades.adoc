== Overview

If you installed using the
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
and the inventory file that was used is available, you can use the upgrade
playbook to automate the OpenShift cluster upgrade process.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you installed using the
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick installation] method
and a *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* file is available, you can use
the quick installer to perform the automated upgrade.
endif::[]

The automated upgrade performs the following steps for you:

* Applies the latest configuration.
* Upgrades and restart master services.
* Upgrades and restart node services.
* Applies the latest cluster policies.
* Updates the default router if one exists.
* Updates the default registry if one exists.
* Updates default image streams and InstantApp templates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you have met all
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[prerequisites]
before proceeding with an upgrade. Failure to do so can result in a failed
upgrade.

== Running Upgrade Playbooks

Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out:

----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----

Then run one of the following upgrade playbooks utilizing the inventory file you
used during the advanced installation. If your inventory file is located
somewhere other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to
specify the location.

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-1-1]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.1

To upgrade from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_0_to_v3_1/upgrade.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *_v3_0_to_v3_1_* in the above path is a reference to the related OpenShift
Enterprise versions, however it is also the correct playbook to use when
upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1.
====

When the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.
After rebooting, continue to Updating Master and Node Certificates.

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-1-1-z-releases]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.1.z Releases

To upgrade an existing OpenShift Origin 1.1 cluster to the latest 1.1.z release,
run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_1_minor/upgrade.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *v3_1_minor* in the above path is a reference to the related OpenShift
Enterprise versions, however it is also the correct playbook to use when
upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.1 to the latest 1.1.z release.
====

When the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.
After rebooting, continue to xref:verifying-the-upgrade[Verifying the Upgrade].

[[preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade]]
== Preparing for an Automated Upgrade

[NOTE]
====
Before upgrading your cluster to {product-title} 3.7, the cluster must be
already upgraded to the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/release_notes/ocp_3_6_release_notes.html#ocp-36-asynchronous-errata-updates[latest asynchronous release of version 3.6]. Cluster upgrades cannot span more than one
minor version at a time, so if your cluster is at a version earlier than 3.6,
you must first upgrade incrementally (e.g., 3.4 to 3.5, then 3.5 to 3.6).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with
xref:../../release_notes/ose_3_2_release_notes.adoc#ose-32-relnotes-rhba-2016-1208[RHBA-2016:1208],
upgrades from {product-title} 3.1 to 3.2 are supported for clusters using the
containerized installation method. See
xref:../../release_notes/ose_3_2_release_notes.adoc#ose-32-known-issues[Known
Issues].
====

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 to 3.2, on each master and
node host you must manually disable the 3.1 channel and enable the 3.2 channel:

. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.6 to 3.7, manually disable the 3.6
channel and enable the 3.7 channel on each master and node host:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.6-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms"
# yum clean all
----
====

. For any upgrade path, always ensure that you have the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package on each RHEL 7 system, which also updates the
*openshift-ansible-** packages:
+
----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

. Before upgrading to {product-title} 3.7, your cluster must be using external etcd (not embedded) and its data must be using the v3 data model:

.. Starting in {product-title} 3.7, embedded etcd is no longer supported. If you
have an {product-title} 3.6 cluster that is using an embeded etcd, you must run
a playbook to migrate it to external etcd. See
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/migrating_embedded_etcd.adoc#install-config-upgrading-etcd-data-migration[Migrating Embedded etcd to External etcd] for steps.

.. If your cluster was initially installed using *openshift-ansible* version
3.6.173.0.21 or later, your etcd data is already using the v3 model. If it was
upgraded from {product-title} 3.5 to 3.6 before then, you must run a playbook to
migrate the data from the v2 model to v3. See
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/migrating_etcd.adoc#install-config-upgrading-etcd-data-migration[Migrating etcd Data (v2 to v3)] for steps.

////
((Steps removed per QE feedback))

. When installing or updating *atomic-openshift-utils*,
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_*  does not get updated with the latest
templates. To update these files:
+
----
# mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
# cp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.7/* /usr/share/openshift/examples/
----

. To persist *_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_* on all masters:
+
----
# mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
# scp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.7/* \
    user@masterx:/usr/share/openshift/examples
----

. You must be logged in as a cluster administrative user on the master host for
the upgrade to succeed:
+
----
$ oc login
----
////

After satisfying these steps, there are two methods for running the automated
upgrade:

- xref:upgrading-using-the-installation-utility-to-upgrade[Using the quick installer]
- xref:running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly[Running the upgrade playbook directly]

Choose and follow one of these methods.

[[upgrading-using-the-installation-utility-to-upgrade]]
== Using the Quick Installer to Upgrade

If you installed {product-title} using the
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick installation] method,
you should have an installation configuration file located at
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. The quick installer requires this file to
start an upgrade.

The quick installer supports upgrading between minor versions of {product-title}
(one minor version at a time, e.g., 3.5 to 3.6) as well as between
xref:../../release_notes/ocp_3_6_release_notes.adoc#ocp-36-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous errata updates] within a minor version (e.g., 3.6.z).

If you have an older format installation configuration file in
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* from an installation of a previous
cluster version, the quick installer will attempt to upgrade the file to the new supported
format. If you do not have an installation configuration file of any format, you
can
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[create one manually].

To start an upgrade with the quick installer:

. Satisfy the steps in xref:preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Preparing for an Automated Upgrade] to ensure you are using the latest upgrade playbooks.

. Run the quick installer with the `upgrade` subcommand:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-installer upgrade
----
. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to upgrade to the latest release.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the quick installer fails, note the error output and check
xref:upgrading_known_issues.adoc#install-config-upgrading-known-issues[Known Issues] for any additional steps.

[[running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly]]
== Running the Upgrade Playbook Directly

The same *_v3_7_* upgrade playbooks can be used for either of the following
scenarios:

- Upgrading existing {product-title} 3.6 clusters to 3.7
- Upgrading existing {product-title} 3.7 clusters to the latest
xref:../../release_notes/ocp_3_7_release_notes.html#ocp-37-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous
errata updates]

[[upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases]]
=== Upgrading the Control Plane and Nodes in Separate Phases

An {product-title} cluster can be upgraded in one or more phases. You can choose
whether to upgrade all hosts in one phase by running a single Ansible playbook,
or upgrade the _control plane_ (master components) and nodes in multiple phases
using separate playbooks.

[NOTE]
====
Instructions on the full upgrade process and when to call these playbooks are
described in xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-7[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title}
3.7 Release].
====

[[upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-2-0]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.0

- master components
- node services running on masters
- Docker running on masters
- Docker running on any stand-alone etcd hosts

When upgrading only the nodes, the control plane must already be upgraded. The
node phase includes upgrading:

- node services running on stand-alone nodes
- Docker running on stand-alone nodes

[NOTE]
====
Nodes running master components are not included during the node upgrade phase,
even though they have node services and Docker running on them. Instead, they
are upgraded as part of the control plane upgrade phase. This ensures node
services and Docker on masters are not upgraded twice (once during the control
plane phase and again during the node phase).
====

[[customizing-node-upgrades]]
=== Customizing Node Upgrades

Whether upgrading in a single or multiple phases, you can customize how the node
portion of the upgrade progresses by passing certain Ansible variables to an
upgrade playbook using the `-e` option.

[NOTE]
====
Instructions on the full upgrade process and when to call these playbooks are
described in xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-7[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title}
3.7 Release].
====

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable can be set to an integer or
percentage to control how many node hosts are upgraded at the same time. The
default is `1`, upgrading nodes one at a time.

For example, to upgrade 20 percent of the total number of detected nodes at a
time:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="20%"
----

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_label` variable allows you to specify that only
nodes with a certain label are upgraded. This can also be combined with the
`openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable.

Then, run the *_v3_1_to_v3_2_* upgrade playbook. If your inventory file is
located somewhere other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i`
flag to specify the location. If you previously used the
`atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your installation, you can check
*_~/.config/openshift/.ansible/hosts_* for the last inventory file that was
used, if needed.

----
# ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_1_to_v3_2/upgrade.yml
----

See xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[Managing Nodes] for more on node labels.


[[upgrade-hooks]]
=== Customizing Upgrades With Ansible Hooks

When upgrading {product-title}, you can execute custom tasks during specific
operations through a system called _hooks_. Hooks allow cluster administrators
to provide files defining tasks to execute before and/or after specific areas
during installations and upgrades. This can be very helpful to validate or
modify custom infrastructure when installing or upgrading {product-title}.

It is important to remember that when a hook fails, the operation fails. This
means a good hook can run multiple times and provide the same results. A great
hook is idempotent.

[[upgrade-hooks-limitations]]
==== Limitations

- Hooks have no defined or versioned interface. They can use internal
*openshift-ansible* variables, but there is no guarantee these will remain in
future releases. In the future, hooks may be versioned, giving you advance
warning that your hook needs to be updated to work with the latest
*openshift-ansible*.
- Hooks have no error handling, so an error in a hook will halt the upgrade
process. The problem will need to be addressed and the upgrade re-run.

[[upgrade-hooks-using-hooks]]
==== Using Hooks

[[upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-3-asynchronous-releases]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Enterprise 3.3 Asynchronous Releases

To apply
xref:../../release_notes/ocp_3_3_release_notes.html#ocp-33-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous errata updates] to an existing {product-title} 3.3 cluster, first upgrade the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system where
you will be running Ansible:

----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

Then, run the same *_v3_3_* upgrade playbook that is used for
xref:upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-3[upgrading to {product-title} 3.3 from
3.2]. If your inventory file is located somewhere other than the default
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to specify the location. If you
previously used the `atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your
installation, you can check *_~/.config/openshift/hosts_* (previously located at
*_~/.config/openshift/.ansible/hosts_*) for the last
inventory file that was used, if needed.

[[upgrade-hooks-available-hooks]]
==== Available Upgrade Hooks

`openshift_master_upgrade_pre_hook`::
- Runs _before_ each master is upgraded.
- This hook runs against _each master_ in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

`openshift_master_upgrade_hook`::
- Runs _after_ each master is upgraded, but _before_ its service or system restart.
- This hook runs against **each master** in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

`openshift_master_upgrade_post_hook`::
- Runs _after_ each master is upgraded and has had its service or system restart.
- This hook runs against _each master_ in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

[[upgrading-to-ocp-3-7]]
=== Upgrading to the Latest {product-title} 3.7 Release

To upgrade an existing {product-title} 3.6 or 3.7 cluster to the latest 3.7
release:

. Satisfy the steps in xref:preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Preparing for an
Automated Upgrade] to ensure you are using the latest upgrade playbooks.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the steps on etcd v2 to v3 migration are satisfied, which is a
special requirement for the {product-title} 3.6 to 3.7 upgrade.
====

. Ensure the `openshift_deployment_type` parameter (formerly called
`deployment_type`) in your inventory file is set to `openshift-enterprise`.

. If you have multiple masters configured and want to enable rolling, full system
restarts of the hosts, you can set the `openshift_rolling_restart_mode`
parameter in your inventory file to `system`. Otherwise, the default value
*services* performs rolling service restarts on HA masters, but does not reboot
the systems. See
xref:../install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-cluster-variables[Configuring
Cluster Variables] for details.

. Run the following command on each host to remove the *atomic-openshift* packages
from the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_3/upgrade.yml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The xref:../../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[manual upgrade
steps] are currently only applicable for
xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[RPM-based
installations]. Manual upgrade steps for
xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[containerized
installations] or clusters with mixed use of both RPM-based and containerized
hosts will be added soon in a documentation update.
====
+
** *Option A)* Upgrade control plane and nodes in a single phase.
+
Run the *_upgrade.yml_* playbook to upgrade the cluster in a single phase using
one playbook; the control plane is still upgraded first, then nodes in-place:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_7/upgrade.yml
----
+
** *Option B)* Upgrade the control plane and nodes in separate phases.

.. To upgrade only the control plane, run the *_upgrade_control_plane.yaml_*
playbook:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_7/upgrade_control_plane.yml
----

.. To upgrade only the nodes, run the *_upgrade_nodes.yaml_* playbook:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_7/upgrade_nodes.yml \
    [-e <customized_node_upgrade_variables>] <1>
----
<1> See xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades] for any desired
`<customized_node_upgrade_variables>`.
+
If you are upgrading the nodes in groups as described in
xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades], continue invoking the
*_upgrade_nodes.yml_* playbook until all nodes have been successfully upgraded.
// tag::automated_upgrade_after_reboot[]

. After all master and node upgrades have completed, a recommendation will be
printed to reboot all hosts. After rebooting, if there are no additional
features enabled, you can xref:verifying-the-upgrade[verify the upgrade].
Otherwise, the next step depends on what additional features have you previously
enabled.

== Upgrading the Service Catalog

// tag::automated-service-catalog-upgrade-steps[]
Starting with {product-title} 3.7, the service catalog, OpenShift Ansible
broker, and template service broker are enabled and deployed by default for new
cluster installations. However, they are not deployed by default during the
upgrade from {product-title} 3.6 to 3.7, so you must run an individual component
playbook separate post-upgrade.

[NOTE]
====
Upgrading from the {product-title} 3.6 Technology Preview version of the service
catalog and service brokers is not supported.
====

To upgrade to these features:

. See the following three sections in the

[[verifying-the-upgrade]]
== Verifying the Upgrade

To verify the upgrade, first check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                 LABELS                                                                STATUS

node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east     Ready
----
====

Then, verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed:

====
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.2.1.4",

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.6",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6",
endif::[]
----
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you upgraded from Origin 1.0 to Origin 1.1, verify in your old
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* files
that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* files.
endif::[]

After upgrading, you can use the diagnostics tool on the master to look for
common issues:
