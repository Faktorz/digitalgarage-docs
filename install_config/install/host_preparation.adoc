[NOTE]
====
If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] to run {product-title}, you
do not need to go through the following sections. These changes are only
necessary when you are setting up the host yourself. If you are using Vagrant,
see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[Contributing
Guide], then you can skip directly to trying out the
xref:../../getting_started/administrators.adoc#try-it-out[sample applications].
