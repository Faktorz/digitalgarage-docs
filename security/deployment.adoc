== Controlling What Can Be Deployed in a Container

In case anything falls through during the build process, or for situations where
a vulnerability is discovered after an image has been deployed, you want yet
another layer of security: tooling for automated, policy-based deployment. This
is particularly important as best practice is not to patch running containers,
but instead use triggers to rebuild and replace with automated updates.

For example:

. An application built using three container image layers: core, middleware, and
the application layer.
. An issue is discovered in the core image and that image is rebuilt.
. Once the build is complete, the image is pushed to the OpenShift Container Registry.
. {product-title} detects that the image has changed. For builds that are
dependent on this image and that have triggers defined, {product-title}
automatically rebuilds and deploys the application image, incorporating the
fixed libraries and ensuring that the code running in production is always
identical to the most recently updated image.

All of these capabilities work together to integrate security capabilities into
your CI/CD process and pipeline.

[[security-deployment-secrets-configmaps]]
== Secrets and ConfigMaps

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords, {product-title} client configuration files, `dockercfg` files,
private source repository credentials, and so on. Secrets decouple sensitive
content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume
plug-in or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.

The `ConfigMap` object holds key-value pairs of configuration data that can be
consumed in pods or used to store configuration data for system components such
as controllers. `ConfigMaps` are similar to secrets, but designed to more
conveniently support working with strings that do not contain sensitive
information.

[[security-deployment-sccs]]
== Security Context Constraints (SCCs)

In addition, {product-title} has built-in _security context constraints_ (SCCs)
that you can use to define a set of conditions that a pod (a collection of
containers) must run with in order to be accepted into the system.

Some aspects that can be managed by SCCs include:

- Running of privileged containers. A key security concept is that processes
should be run with the least possible privilege; this is true for containers as
well. You do not want your containers to run as root unless absolutely
necessary. SCCs include a policy that enforces "if a container requires root
access, you cannot deploy it."
- Capabilities a container can request to be added.
- Use of host directories as volumes.
- SELinux context of the container.
- Container user ID.

Users with the required permissions can adjust the default SCC policies to be
more permissive if they choose.

[[security-deployment-cd-tooling]]
== CD Tooling

As with CI tooling, users can integrate their own continuous deploymenet (CD)
tooling with {product-title} if they prefer.

Ultimately, by leveraging CI/CD and {product-title}, the entire process of
rebuilding the application to incorporate the latest fixes, testing, and
ensuring that it is deployed everywhere within the environment can be fully
automated.
