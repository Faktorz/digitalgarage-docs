Roles and Access Management in a Cluster Federation

In July of 2016, Kubernetes 1.3 introduced Kubernetes Federated Clusters.  Federation is useful for very large scale, global deployments. Multiple clusters can be useful for high-availability across multiple availability zones or to enable common management of deployments or migrations across multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

If you are managing federated clusters, you need to be sure that your orchestration tools provide the security you need across the different deployment platforms. As always, authentication and authorization are key. Kubernetes 1.4 extends Cluster Federation to include support for Federated Secrets and Federated Namespaces and Ingress objects.

Federated Secrets automatically create and manage secrets across all clusters in a Federation, automatically ensuring that these are kept globally consistent and up-to-date, even if some clusters are offline when the original updates are applied.
Federated Namespaces are similar to the traditional Kubernetes Namespaces providing the same functionality. Creating them in the Federation control plane ensures that they are synchronized across all the clusters in Federation.

Red Hat is working to add these capabilities to OpenShift.
