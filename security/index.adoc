== About This Guide

This guide provides a high-level walkthrough of the container security measures
available in {product-title}, including solutions for the host layer, the
container and orchestration layer, and the build and application layer. After
reading this guide, you should be able to identify:

- Why container security is important and how it compares with existing security standards.
- Which container security measures are provided by the host (RHEL) layer and which are provided uniquely from {product-title}.
- How to evaluate your container content and sources for vulnerabilities.
- How to design your build and deployment process to proactively check container content.
- How to control access to containers via authentication and authorization.
- How networking and attached storage are secured in {product-title}.

[[security-intro-what-are-containers]]
== What Are Containers?

Containers have broad appeal for the ability they provide to easily package an
application and all its dependencies into a single image that can be promoted
from development, to test, to production, without change.

Containers make it easy to ensure consistency across environments and multiple
deployment targets: physical servers, virtual machines (VMs), and private or
public cloud. All of this helps teams to develop and manage the applications
that drive business value with greater agility.

Therefore, depending on whether you are asking a system administrator or an
application developer, the benefits of containers may sound slightly different:

|===
|INFRASTRUCTURE |APPLICATIONS

|Sandboxed application processes on a shared Linux OS kernel
|Package my application and all of its dependencies

|Simpler, lighter, and denser than virtual machines
|Deploy to any environment in seconds and enable CI/CD

|Portable across different environments
|Easily access and share containerized components

== Securing Containers for Enterprise Use

Enterprise use of containers requires strong security. In many ways, securing
containers is a lot like securing any running process. You need to think about
security throughout the layers of the solution stack before you deploy and run
your containers. You also need to think about security throughout the
application and container life cycle.

This guide describes the key elements of security for each layer of the
container solution stack, while also showing how {product-title} can be used to
to create, deploy, and manage containers at scale, with security in mind at
every stage and every layer.
