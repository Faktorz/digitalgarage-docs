=== Managing Container Deployment at Scale

Applications are rarely delivered in a single container. Even simple
applications typically have a front end, a back end, and a database. Deploying
modern microservices based applications in containers means deploying multiple
containers, sometimes on the same host and sometimes distributed across multiple
node hosts as shown in the following diagram:

image::orchestration.png["Container Orchestration", align="center"]

Managing container deployment at scale must consider the following questions:

- Which containers should be deployed to which hosts?
- Which host has more capacity?
- Which containers need access to each other? How will they discover each other?
- How do you control access to and management of shared resources, like network and storage?
- How do you monitor container health?
- How do you automatically scale application capacity to meet demand?
- How can I enable developer self-service while also meeting security requirements?

To address these questions, {product-title} has built-in management and security
features, allowing your team to focus your energies on building the applications
that provide business value.

[[security-orchestration-kubernetes-masters-and-apis]]
=== Kubernetes Masters and APIs

{product-title} delivers container orchestration, automation of scheduling and
running application containers on clusters of physical or virtual machines,
through inclusion and extension of the open source Kubernetes project.
Kubernetes, originally developed by Google, uses master hosts to manage the
complexity of container cluster orchestration.

Given the wealth of capabilities for both developers and operators, strong
role-based access control is a critical element of the container platform. For
example, the orchestration masters are a central point of access and should
receive the highest level of security scrutiny.

APIs are key to automating container management at scale. APIs are used to:

- Validate and configure the data for pods, services, and replication controllers.
- Perform project validation on incoming requests and invoke triggers on other
major system components.

[[security-platform-auth]]
== Authentication and Authorization

[[security-platform-auth-controlling-access]]
=== Controlling Access Using OAuth

API access control via authentication and authorization is critical for securing
your container platform. The {product-title} master includes a built-in OAuth
server. Developers and administrators obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate
themselves to the API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth to authenticate using the _identity
provider_ of your choice, including:

- Keystone
- LDAP
- Basic Authentication
- GitHub / GitLab
- Google
- OpenID Connect
- and more.

[[security-platform-auth-secure-self-service-web-console]]
=== Secure Self-service Web Console

One of the key values of a container platform is the ability to enable developer
self-service, making it easier and faster for your development teams to deliver
applications built on approved layers. Multi-tenancy security is a must for the
platform itself to make sure teams do not access each other's environments
without authorization.

{product-title} provides a self-service web console that gives enough control to
teams to foster collaboration while still providing security. {product-title}
adds several components to Kubernetes to ensure a secure multi-tenant master:

- All access to the master is over TLS
- Access to the API Server is X.509 certificate or token based
- Project quota is used to limit how much damage a rogue token could do
- Etcd is not exposed directly to the cluster

[[security-platform-cert-mgmt]]
== Managing Certificates for the Platform

{product-title} has multiple components within its framework that use REST-based
HTTPS communication leveraging encryption via TLS certificates.
{product-title}'s Ansible-based installer configures these certificates during
installation. There are some primary components that generate this traffic:

- masters (API server and controllers)
- etcd
- nodes
- registry
- router

Administrators can optionally configure custom serving certificates for the
public host names of the API server and web console. The installer also provides
playbooks for checking on the expiration dates of all cluster certificates, as
well as redeploying them automatically.
