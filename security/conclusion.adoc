Of course, it is not just about security; your container platform needs to
provide an experience that works for your developers and your operations team.
You need a secure, enterprise-grade, container-based application platform that
enables application developers and operators, without compromising the functions
needed by both teams, while also improving operational efficiency and
infrastructure utilization.

Given the nature of today's business applications - always on, available from
any location and on multiple devices - you also need advanced scheduling and
automated placement with regions and zones for high availability deployments.

{product-title} is built on a core of standard and portable Linux containers in
the Docker packaging format. It delivers built-in security features including:

- Strong role-based access controls, with integrations to enterprise
authentication systems.
- Powerful, web-scale container orchestration and management with Google
Kubernetes.
- Integrated RHEL 7 and RHEL Atomic Host, optimized for running containers at
scale with SELinux enabled for strong isolation.
- Integration with public and private container registries.
- Integrated CI/CD tools for secure DevOps practices.
- A new model for container networking.
- Support for remote storage volumes.
