== Where Do Your Containers Come From?

As discussed, there are tools you can use to scan and track the contents of your
downloaded and deployed container images. However, there are many public sources
of container images. When using public container registries, you can add a layer
of protection by using trusted sources.

[[security-registries-immutable-and-certified-containers]]
== Immutable and Certified Containers

Consuming security updates is particularly important when managing _immutable
containers_. Immutable containers are containers that will never be changed
while running.

Container images are a packaged, layered collection of binaries. When a bug is
discovered in a deployed binary, you do not edit the binary in place; you fix
the bug in the source code, rebuild the binary, and replace the broken binary
with the newly rebuilt binary.

When you deploy immutable containers, you do not step into the running container
to replace one or more binaries; you rebuild and redeploy an updated container
image.

The list of known vulnerabilities is constantly evolving, so you need to track
the contents of your deployed container images, as well as newly downloaded
images, over time. Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) will alert you to any
newly discovered issues in Red Hat certified container images and direct you to
the updated image.

Certification of a container from Red Hat means that:

- The container image is free of known vulnerabilities in the platform components
or layers.
- The container is compatible across the RHEL platforms, from bare metal to cloud.
- The complete stack is supported by Red Hat and partners.

== Red Hat Registry and Red Hat Container Catalog

Red Hat provides certified containers for Red Hat products and partner offerings
via the _Red Hat Registry_, which is a public container registry hosted by Red
Hat at link:https://registry.access.redhat.com[registry.access.redhat.com]. The
_Red Hat Container Catalog_ at
link:https://access.redhat.com/containers[access.redhat.com/containers] provides
a web-based front end to the Red Hat Registry where you can identify bug fix or
security advisories associated with a container image.

When Red Hat releases security updates, such as fixes to *glibc*, Drown or Dirty
Cow, any affected container images are also rebuilt and pushed to the Red Hat
Registry.

[[security-registries-openshift-container-registry]]
== OpenShift Container Registry

Public container registries are an important use case. However, your teams are
building containers that layer content on top of the public container images you
download. You need to manage access to and promotion of the downloaded container
images and the internally built images in the same way you manage access to and
promotion of other types of binaries.

{product-title} includes the _OpenShift Container Registry_, a private registry
that runs integrated with the platform that you can use to manage your container
images. The OpenShift Container Registry provides role-based access controls
that allow you to manage who can pull and push which container images.

{product-title} also supports integration with other private registries you may
already be using.
