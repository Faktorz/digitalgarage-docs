== The OS Matters

Containers make it easier for developers to build and promote the application
and its dependencies as a unit. Containers also make it easy to get the most use
of your servers by simplifying multi-tenancy deployments. You can easily deploy
multiple applications on a single host, using the kernel and the docker runtime
to spin up each individual container.

To take full advantage of this packaging and deployment technology, an
operations team needs the right environment for running containers. You need an
operating system (OS) that can secure the host kernel and secure containers from
each other.

Because {product-title} runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and RHEL Atomic
Host, the following concepts apply by default to any deployed {product-title}
cluster and are at the core of what make containers secure on the platform.

== How Containers are Secured on RHEL

In Linux, containers are really just a special type of process, so your approach
to securing containers should be the same as your approach to securing any
running process. Dropping privileges is important and still recommended, though
even better is to create containers with the least privileges possible.
Containers should run as a non-root user.

There are multiple levels of security features available for securing containers
running on RHEL and RHEL Atomic Host:

- _Linux namespaces_ provide the fundamentals of container isolation. A namespace
makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own
instance of global resources. Namespaces provide the abstraction that gives the
impression you are running on your own operating system when you are inside a
container.

- _SELinux_ provides an additional layer of security to keep containers isolated
from each other and from the host. SELinux allows administrators to enforce
mandatory access controls (MAC) for every user, application, process, and file.
SELinux is the brick wall that is going to stop you if you manage to break out
of (accidentally or on purpose) the namespace abstraction.

- _CGroups_ (or control groups) limit, account for, and isolate the resource usage
(CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes. CGroups are
used to ensure your container will not impacted by another container on the same
host.

- Finally, a _secure computing mode (seccomp)_ profile can be associated with a
container to restrict available system calls.

You can further enhance security for your applications and infrastructure by
deploying your containers to RHEL Atomic Host. RHEL Atomic Host reduces the attack
surface by minimizing the host environment and tuning it for containers.

As a proof point of the security features available to you with RHEL and RHEL
Atomic Host, RHEL 7.1 recently received Common Criteria certification, including
certification of the Linux Container Framework Support.

[[security-host-multi-tenancy]]
== Multi-tenancy: Virtualization Versus Containers

Traditional virtualization also enables multi-tenancy, but in a very different
way from containers. Virtualization relies on a hypervisor spinning up guest
virtual machines (VMs), each of which has its own operating system (OS), as well
as the running application and its dependencies.

With VMs, the hypervisor isolates the guests from each other and from the host
kernel. Fewer individuals and processes have access to the hypervisor, reducing
the attack surface on the physical server. That said, security must still be
monitored: one guest VM may be able to use hypervisor bugs to gain access to
another VM or the host kernel. And, when the OS needs patching, it must be
patched on all guest VMs using that OS.

Containers can be run inside guest VMs, and there may be use cases where this is
desirable. For example, you may be deploying a traditional application in a
container, perhaps in order to lift-and-shift an application to the cloud.
However, container multi-tenancy on a single host provides a more lightweight,
flexible, and easier-to-scale deployment solution. This deployment model is
particularly appropriate for cloud-native applications.
