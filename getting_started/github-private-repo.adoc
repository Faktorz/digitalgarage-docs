== Overview

This getting started tutorial walks you through the easiest way to configure your
Quickstart template to build source from a private Github repository. We will be
using the MEAN Stack Quickstart template in this example.

The following sections guide you through creating a project that contains a
sample MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS and Node.js) application that
will serve a welcome page. This requires
two xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pods]:

- one to host the Node.js/Express.js server and AngularJS application
- one to host the MongoDB database

The tutorial assumes that you have:

- a {product-title} account.
- a https://github.com/[GitHub] account.
- https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/[Git] installed locally.

[[btb_setup]]
== Setup

In this section, you will _fork_ the {product-title} MEAN sample application
on GitHub and clone the repository to your local machine so that you can deploy
and edit the application.

[NOTE]
====
You can skip this step if you already forked the
https://github.com/thedigitalgarage/mean-ex[*thedigitalgarage/mean-ex*] repository.
====

. On GitHub, navigate to the
https://github.com/thedigitalgarage/mean-ex[*thedigitalgarage/mean-ex*] repository. In the
top-right corner of the page, click *Fork*:
+
image::gs-fork.png[Fork the project]

. Next, execute the following commands on your local machine to clone the sample
application and change to the new directory:
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/mean-ex
$ cd mean-ex
----

That's it! Now, you have a fork of the original *thedigitalgarage/mean-ex* example
application Git repository and a copy on your local machine.

[[btb-installing-the-digital-garage-cli]]
== Installing  CLI

In this section, you will install the {product-title} CLI. The {product-title}
CLI exposes commands for managing your applications, as well as lower level
tools to interact with each component of your system.

. First, download the {product-title} CLI from the https://apps.thedigitalgarage.io:8443/console/command-line[
*Command Line Tools*] page in the
{product-title} web console. You find the Command Line Tools menu item under the
Support button (?) on the left side of the top menu bar. The CLI is available
for Linux (32- or 64-bit), Mac OS X, and Windows. After you have downloaded the
CLI, return to these steps.

. Next, unpack or unzip the archive and move the `oc` binary to a directory on
your `*PATH*`.
+
[NOTE]
====
To check your `*PATH*` on Linux or Mac OS X, open the Terminal and run:

----
$ echo $PATH
----

To check it on Windows, open the Command Prompt and run:

----
C:\> path
----
====
+
After it is installed, you can use the `oc` command from your command shell.

. Then, visit the https://apps.thedigitalgarage.io:8443/console/command-line[
*Command Line Tools*] page in the {product-title} web console and copy the
`oc login` command shown with your current session token to log in to
{product-title} from the CLI:
+
----
$ oc login https://apps.thedigitalgarage.io:8443 --token=<your_session_token>
----
+
The `oc login` command is the best way to initially set up the {product-title}
CLI. The information is automatically saved in a CLI configuration file that is
then used for subsequent commands.

[[btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code]]
== Creating a New Application from Source Code

In this section, you will deploy your first application to {product-title} using
the web console.

. First, if you have multiple projects, verify that you are in the correct project.
Replace `<project_name>` below with a unique name for your project, such as
`<your_github_username>-example`:
+
----
$ oc project <project_name>
----
+

+
[NOTE]
====
If you followed the xref:../getting_started/basic_walkthrough.adoc#getting-started-basic-walkthrough[Basic
Walkthrough] topic, you already created your first project. You must switch to
your project namespace and clear out the original sample application.

.. Use the following command to find the name of your existing project(s):
+
----
$ oc get projects
----

.. Next, switch to your project namespace:
+
----
$ oc project <your_project_name>
----

.. Then, delete all existing objects in your project:
+
----
$ oc delete all --all
----

.. Use the following command to find the name of your existing persistent
volume claims:
+
----
$ oc get pvc
----

.. Finally, if any exist, delete your existing persistent volume claims with:
+
----
$ oc delete pvc mongodb
----

== Creating a New Application from a quickstart template
In this section you will follow the steps outlined in the
xref:../getting_started/basic_walkthrough.adoc#getting-started-basic-walkthrough[Basic Walkthrough] section.
this time, however, you will be deploying a MEAN Stack Application which is very similar
to the Node.js application deployed in that tutorial.

. First, we will create a xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.adoc#using-secrets-during-build[build secret] that will
be passed to Github during the build process.
+
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth SECRETNAME --username=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD
----

[NOTE]
====
In this example we will be using a Secret with Basic Authentication. You can use other
Authentication methods with Github. See the Developer Guide on xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.adoc#using-secrets-during-build[Secrets]
for more information.
====

. Navigate to the https://apps.thedigitalgarage.io/console/[welcome
page] of the {product-title} web console. If you have not created a project, follow the
instructions in the xref:../getting_started/basic_walkthrough.adoc#getting-started-basic-walkthrough[Basic Walkthrough] section of
the Getting Started Guide.

. Choose your project by clicking on the project card. This will take you to the Project Overview
screen for your new project. At this point your project will be empty.

. We are first going to modify the qs-mean template to include the build secret we
just created. A copy of the MEAN Quickstart template is located in the openshift/templates
folder of the mean-ex repository you forked earlier. You can also get a copy here:
https://github.com/thedigitalgarage/mean-ex/blob/master/openshift/templates/qs-mean.json[*https://github.com/thedigitalgarage/mean-ex/blob/master/openshift/templates/qs-mean.json*]

. Open the qs-mean.json Quickstart template in your favorite editor locate the "spec" section for the
Build configuration at approximately line 74.
----
{
  "kind": "BuildConfig",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "${NAME}",
    "annotations": {
      "description": "Defines how to build the application"
   }
  },
  "spec": {
    "source": {
      "type": "Git",
      "git": {
        "uri": "${SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL}",
        "ref": "${SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF}"
      },
      "contextDir": "${CONTEXT_DIR}"
    },
----

Before the "contextDir" key, add the following:
----
"sourceSecret": {
  "name": "SECRETNAME"
},
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace SECRETNAME with the name you used for the secret.
====

The resulting change should look like this:
----
{
  "kind": "BuildConfig",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "${NAME}",
    "annotations": {
      "description": "Defines how to build the application"
   }
  },
  "spec": {
    "source": {
      "type": "Git",
      "git": {
        "uri": "${SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL}",
        "ref": "${SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF}"
      },
      "sourceSecret": {
        "name": "my-secret"
      },
      "contextDir": "${CONTEXT_DIR}"
    },
----

. Save the template file to your local working directory.

. We are going to add the modified MEAN Quickstart template to your project/workspace
by first selecting `Add to Project` link on the top of the screen. This will take you
to the Add to Project screen with a catalog of Quickstart templates, Instant Applications, DataBase templates
Builders for different languages.

. Choose "Import YAML/JSON" tab at the top of the page.
+
image::dg-select-quickstart.png[Select Quickstart templates]

. On the "Import YAML/JSON" screen, you will have the option to either paste the text
from you edited Quickstart template or browse your local file system to choose the
template that you saved in the previous step. Upload the saved template and click the
*[ Create ]* button at the bottom of the page.
+
image::dg-import-json-yaml-add-to-project.png[Import YAML/JSON]

. If your template is well formed, a pop-up screen will ask some additional questions.
Check both the "Process the template" and "Save template" checkboxes. Click the *[ Continue ]*
button.
+
image::dg-process-template.png[Save template Popup]

. In the next screen, replace the repository URL in the *Git Repository URL* parameter
with your URL to your private GitHub repository. Use the default values provided for all other
parameters:
+
image::dg-change-git-url.png[Change Git URL]

. Finally, scroll to the bottom of the page and click *[ Create ]* to deploy your
application.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can follow along on the *Overview* page of the web console to see the new
resources being created, and watch the progress of the build and deployment.
While the MongoDB pod is being created, its status is shown as pending. The
MongoDB pod then starts up and displays its newly-assigned IP address.

[[bw-viewing-your-running-application]]
== Viewing Your Running Application

In this section, you will view your running application using a web browser.

In the https://apps.thedigitalgarage.io/console/[web console], view
the *Overview* page for your project to determine the web address for your
application. Click the web address displayed underneath the
*QS MEAN* service to open your application in a new browser tab:

[NOTE]
====
You can find all routes configured for your project at any time in the web
console:

. From the web console, navigate to the project containing your application.
. Click the *[ Browse ]* tab, then click *[ Routes ]*.
. Click the host name to open your application in a browser new tab.
